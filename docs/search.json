    "text": "Contact Information\nDr. Sara Knox\nsara.knox@mcgill.ca\nThe conservation of wetlands to prevent the destruction and degradation of important carbon stocks, as well as the recognition of the role of ecosystems in climate change mitigation and adaptation, are priorities set by the governments of Quebec and Canada.\nThis project aims to improve understanding the carbon sequestration capacity of key wetland types across Canada to better quantify the role of wetlands as nature-based climate solutions to fight climate change. This includes quantifying the net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) of four types of wetlands under natural conditions (open bog, forested bog, treed swamp, and coastal marsh) to help prioritizing the protection and conservation of areas with the strongest capacity to mitigate climate change. We will also quantify the NECB of the same wetland types under disturbed conditions as knowledge about the impacts of anthropogenic disturbances on the carbon balances of these wetlands. This comparison between natural and disturbed conditions will help our partners (Ministère de l’Environnement, de la Lutte contre le changement climatique, de la Faune et des Parcs (MELCCFP), Ducks Unlimited Canada and Nature Conservancy Canada - Québec) to support decisions for carbon stocks conservation, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and optimization of carbon sequestration in soils and biomass.\nThe NECB approach integrates land-atmosphere gas exchange (i.e., vertical fluxes), carbon accumulation in soils and biomass, and lateral carbon export (i.e., lateral fluxes) in its various forms. This will be realized through a watershed-scale continuum approach. The support of the Quebec government in this project request is significant because the proposed research will have concrete implications through conservation and land-use practices not only for Quebec but also for Canada.",

    "text": "This research is a unique opportunity to improve understanding and prediction of the potential role of wetlands as Nature-based Climate Solutions (NbCS). Our project is the largest and most comprehensive and integrative assessment of wetland carbon dynamics and balances in Canada to date and will provide much needed new data to carry out robust, evidence-based assessments of the capacity of natural and disturbed wetlands to mitigate climate change. This research is unique in integrating all components of the C cycle to provide a robust and realistic assessment of C and GHG budgets across wetland ecosystems that are of particular importance in the Canadian landscape. By integrating lateral and vertical fluxes and combining them with soil core observations, our work will allow us to develop reliable estimates of Net Ecosystem Carbon Balance (NECB) and assess the long-term C dynamics and the impacts of anthropogenic disturbances on wetlands. Our research and collaborations also provide a unique opportunity for improving wetland biogeochemical models.\nSpecifically, our work will further improve wetland C cycle science in Quebec and Canada, provide key information for policy makers, guide the management and restoration of wetlands for different levels of governments, contribute to climate change mitigation accounting, and support climate action initiatives across regional, provincial, and federal levels. Furthermore, by improving biogeochemical models, we will contribute to better quantifying C emissions and removals from land-use change and management of wetlands in Canada, which will ultimately reduce uncertainty in Canadian inventory reporting.",

    "text": "What is a Branch?\n\n\nBranches can be thought of like limbs on a tree, or perhaps a more accurate analogy can be taken from hydrology, by comparing them to an anbranching river channel.\n\nBranches are separate “streams” of code that break off of the main “channel”. Some branches may be dead ends that don’t end up going anywhere. While some branches may lead lead to improvements that can be incorporated back into the main branch of the codebase. Others may break off from the main project entirely.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn anabranching section of the Mackenzie River Delta.\n\n\n\n\n\nBranch Protection Rules\nWe use branch protection rules to protect the main codebase. All changes to the main branch of a protected repository, must be submitted via a “pull request” using a separate branch. This allows for review of the changes by other users before changes are incorporated. It adds an extra level of security by protecting the main branch of code from the erroneous keystrokes of novice and expert users alike! These rules are act as a “gate” that helps ensure any changes to operational code are intentional and agreed upon by relevant parties. If you try to push (force) a change to the main branch of a protected repository on our GitHub, you’ll be given an error message and told to submit a pull request instead!

    "text": "Common Git Tasks\n\nCreating a Repo From Scratch\nSay you have a collection of code that you want to add to a local repository. The syntax would be as follows:\ngit init -b main\ngit add some_program.py\ngit commit -am \"First Commit: Adding my initial code to repo\"\nWhat is happening here?\ninit: Creates an empty repository with a “branch” (-b) named “main”\nadd: indicates that “some_program.py” will be tracked within the repo. Other files in the repo will not be tracked unless you explicitly add them. Alternatively bash git add . would all all files within the repo. There are more complex patterns that can be setup to explicitly exclude/include some files using “.gitignore” files, but that’s a topic for another day.\ncommit: Tells git to “save” a permanent copy of all (-a) tracked files in the repo in there current state and leave a commit message (-m) to leave important notes about the commit. Commit messages are extremely helpful, both for reminding yourself what happened, and indicating to collaborators what’s included in a commit.\n\nYou should avoid leaving short/nondescript commit messages such as “updated code”, because that doesn’t help anyone\nIt is good practice to make a commit any time you make an important change to your project!\n\n\nAdding Your New Repository to GitHub\nGo to github.com and follow the steps outlined in the images bellow:\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Create a new repository\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Give it the same name as your local repo. Accept all defaults then click create.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. The next window will open an empty repo. Copy the url go back to your local git repo and execute the commands listed bellow.\n\n\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/June-Skeeter/SomeTest.git\ngit push --set-upstream origin main\nThese commands will tell your local git where the remote (on the cloud) version of your repository is located and then “push” your local copy to the cloud. If you go back to the github repo and refresh the webpage, you’ll see that whatever files were in your local copy are now visible remotely!"

    "section": "Working With an Existing Repository",
    "text": "Working With an Existing Repository\nMore often than not, you’ll end up working with an existing repository. You may need to make some changes, which can be added back to the main branch (following the branch protection rules!) or you may just need to run some fully developed code locally on your computer. For example, maybe you need to do some processing for the HOGG site in Manitoba. You can “download” a local copy of the repo and create a branch for your local changes as follows:\ngit clone https://github.com/ubc-micromet/Calculation_Procedures.git\ngit checkout -b MyHoggUpdates\nWhat is happening here?\nclone:: Tells git to download a local copy a repository from a remote location (i.e. a github URL) to your computer.\ncheckout: Tells git to create an new branch (-b) with the name “MyHoggUpdates”. This branch will contain all of your own adjustments, but the main branch on your local machine will not be altered! If you break something (e.g., delete an important code block), its easy to go back to the main branch. Just type bash git checkout main to go back in to the main branch. Note only need to add bash -b after bash checkout when creating a new branch. Git will automatically revert all files in the repo the the main version.\n\nContributing your Changes\nProvided you have permission to write to the repository (this is granted on a per-user basis by repo “owners”), you can contribute any changes you make by pushing a copy of your branch to github. Say you added a new file “new_HOGG_file.ini”, you could add it, commit it, then push to git hub as follows:\ngit add new_HOGG_file.ini\ngit commit -am \"A relevant description of your changes\"\ngit push --set-upstream origin MyHoggUpdates\nNote you only need to run the --set-upstream origin Test once per branch. The second, third, hundredth push you can simply type git push\n\n\nPulling Remote Changes\nSay there were some important updates to the main remote branch that you need to incorporate to code on your local branch. Starting from within MyHoggUpdates You could:\ngit checkout main\ngit pull\ngit checkout MyHoggUpdates\ngit merge main\npull downloads all the changes from the main branch on github to your local machine.\nmerge will automatically incorporate any changes for files that don’t conflict with changes you’ve made to files locally. i.e., if you’re working on “new_HOGG_file.ini”, but someone else changed “existing_BB_file.ini” then the updates to “existing_BB_file.ini” will be brought in without causing any “merge conflicts”. If you also made an edit to “existing_BB_file.ini” that does not match the incoming change, it will create a merge conflict, that needs to be resolved manually."

We will also compare whether the C budgets measured by vertical and horizontal fluxes (Objective 2 and 3) corresponds to the variation of soil C sequestration through the &lt;150-year time period. The results of these comparisons are of importance both technically (i.e., validating the closure of the C budget) and scientifically (i.e., exploring the long-term vs. short-term dynamics of the C budgets), and will result in: 1) a synthesis of C stock and sequestration rates in the soil and plant biomass of natural and disturbed wetlands across southern Quebec, and 2) the development of a decision tool for hotspots of C in wetland conservation. We expect that while natural wetlands will act as net C sinks, disturbed wetlands may be C sources, with the magnitude of the source increasing with the level of disturbance.",

An eddy covariance (EC) tower will be installed in each wetland type both natural and disturbed for a total of 8 towers supported by the MELCCFP. A 9th tower will be contributed from McGill in a restored site near Lac Saint-Pierre (LSP). These towers will measure vertical (gaseous) fluxes including net CO2 exchange (NEP, which is the balance between gross ecosystem productivity and ecosystem respiration) and net CH4 exchange (the balance between methanogenesis and methanotrophy). Continuous, year-round EC observations will provide robust annual vertical C and GHG budgets for each site. While we expect lower CH4 emissions from disturbed (i.e., drained wetlands), we anticipate that this will be outweighed by significantly higher CO2 emissions, making the disturbed sites a larger net GHG source than the natural wetlands. For each site, the impact of disturbance on fluxes will also be investigated. Additionally, the quasi-continuous nature of these C and GHG flux measurements coupled with ancillary measurements (e.g., radiation, temperature, relative humidity, soil moisture, water table depth) will allow us to investigate the dominant controls on GHG fluxes and assess how C fluxes will respond to a changing climate and intensifying disturbance regimes.",

This will require a detailed characterization of the water balance and the hydrologic connectivity with surface and groundwater in each of the target ecosystems. Additionally, a detailed biogeochemical quantification (including dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), partitional pressure of CO2 and CH4 (pCO2 and pCH4, respectively), and water chemistry) of the outflows of the studied wetlands including interstitial and groundwater will be conducted. This will allow us to quantify the net lateral C and GHG budgets of natural and disturbed wetlands across southern Quebec. These comparative case studies will allow us to derive general patterns of C export based on landscape and hydrologic features, which will be used to upscale C export at a regional level. Mechanistic models of lateral C export will also be developed to assess how climate-induced change and human disturbance may impact this important aspect of the wetland ecosystem C balance. We expect that C export will comprise a significant yet varying component of the C budget of the different wetland ecosystems, but that in all cases, these lateral C fluxes will be essential for closure of the NECB.",
