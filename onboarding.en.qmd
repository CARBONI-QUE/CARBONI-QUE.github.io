## Project onboarding

If you have just joined the project, welcome! As some first steps, please

1. contact Martina and/or Léonie so that they can add you to the project's SharePoint and Teams group.
2. send your bio and picture to Martina so that she can add you to the project website.

Using the SharePoint and Teams should be rather straightforward for UQAM team members. However, if you are trying to log on with an external account, things can prove more challenging.
